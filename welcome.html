    <p><u>HTML</u> stands for HyperText Markup Language.
        It is the language that is used to structure web pages. HTML contains the content of a web page which users can see, and also some information that the user's browser interprets to format the content, but doesn't explicitly show to the user.</p>
    <h2>Elements and Tags</h2>
    <p>These are called <u>element tags</u>. They inform the browser how to display the page. They look like this:&ltdiv&gt <div>
    They almost always come with a <em>closing</em> tag somewhere later that looks like this:&lt&#47div&gt </div>
    Whatever is between the opening tag and the closing tag is called an <u>element</u>. Let's create some...<br>
    In order to make a <u>main header</u>, we wrap the content of the header in an &lth1&gt; tag.
    And to set some content as a paragraph element, we use &lt;p&gt; tags.</p>
